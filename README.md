# 315ProjectCode
The code I worked on (as I worked on it) that would be used by students and instructors in Queen's University's PHYS 315 class. The published version meant for people to use should be available elsewhere.


client.py is a class used to access and interface with the Nova.Astrometry.Net API. I did not create it, nor modify it, and simply use it as part of the Astrometry Notebook I have created. The code was downloaded from https://github.com/dstndstn/astrometry.net/blob/main/net/client/client.py in May of 2023.
