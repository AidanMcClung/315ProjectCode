# 315ProjectCode
The code I worked on (as I worked on it) that would be used by students and instructors in Queen's University's PHYS 315 class. The published version meant for people to use should be available elsewhere.

As of Jul 28, 2023, A naming scheme was adopted using the acronym "QAOP" to denote relevant components, with the idea of eventually having that be a package name all of the files are bundled into. (The acronym is: Queens Astrophysics Observing Project) 


client.py is a class used to access and interface with the Nova.Astrometry.Net API. I did not create it, nor modify it, and simply use it as part of the Astrometry Notebook I have created. The code was downloaded from https://github.com/dstndstn/astrometry.net/blob/main/net/client/client.py in May of 2023.
