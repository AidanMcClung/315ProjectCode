    "This involves an exercise, which will be either included in the first assignment, or submitted and marked on its own. The exercise is to be submitted individually, and each student should be looking up their own info, however, they are allowed to work on it together. (ie, 5 students may work together to create 5 reports) ((Each student will be assigned their own values/items)) \n",
