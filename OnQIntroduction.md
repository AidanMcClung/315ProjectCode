## Exoplanet Observing Project

As undergraduate students, you are generally new to the field and don't have much practical experience. One goal that we had in mind that we wanted to do in order to help your education, is to design and have a project that you could complete, and both demonstrate your understanding of concepts taught in the course and evaluate you in that regard, while also being something you would be interested in and excited to do. It would be an exceptional quality if this project also built on your education in some way that would otherwise not be acheivable. It is, obviously, hard to find something that everyone will find interesting, but we have chosen a topic that hopefully most of you will find interesting.

## what is an exoplanet

Over the course of this semester, you will be divided up into groups, and, with your group, you will plan and conduct an observation of an astronomical phenomenon; the transit of an exoplanet. 

The term 'exoplanet' refers quite simply to any planet that orbits a star other than our own. All other star systems are too far away for us to observe any planets directly the same way we're able to observe those planets in our own solar system. However, there are multiple ways to detect such exoplanets that have become fairly common and feasible in recent years. The one we will be using is its detection through observation of its transit.

## what is transit detection

As a planet orbits its star, it may have a variety of planes in which it rotates. In the event that such an orbital plane lines up with, and cuts through, the line of sight to star for a distant observer, the planet would then eclipse its star everytime it is in the right part of its orbit.

As it passes in front of the star, the planet will block some amount of the light that the star is producing. As an observer on Earth, we can look at stars and continually measure their brightness. If we see a periodic dip in the brightness of a star, we might have detected an exoplanet. 
(There are a few more caveats to this; further conditions and such, but that is the general explanation of what we're doing)

*(This star absolutely needs to have a little smile drawn onto it)*

This dip in a 'light curve' is what we will be attempting to observe during our project.
The best way to observe and identify (new) exoplanet transits would be to have a telescope (or multiple telescopes) that looked at EVERY star, ALWAYS, and then you could find all the ones with exoplanet transits. This is far beyond our capabilities, and in fact, has already been done at the possible levels, leading to the discovery of 5470 exoplanets so far.
(The rate of discovery is currently such that this number is probably already outdated. It was 5470 on Jul 21, 2023, at 4:30 pm. The current number is displayed on the homepage of the Exoplanet Archive for those curious about what it is now)

What we will be doing is observing the transit of a known, already discovered exoplanet. This is done fairly commonly, because an observer can watch for changes in the transit's properties in order to learn otherwise inaccessible information.

I have compiled a list of suggested targets; exoplanet transits that are possible to observe with the telescopes we have access to, and ones that should be fairly forgiving should you encounter problems along the way and need to try again. Many of these exoplanets have interesting details about them nonetheless, and I'd encourage you to try and learn a little bit about whatever planet you do end up observing.

## how will we do this

Using a service from a company called iTelescope, we will be renting time and remotely conducting observations using much higher quality telescopes than you would have otherwise had access to.
Using these telescopes, we will take pictures of a part of the sky containing our target. We will then use a selection of tools to analyze these images; the main idea is that we want to extract a numerical value for the 'brightness' of the star from each image.


You will be divided into small groups; you may choose your groups if you would like, or you can opt to be assigned to a random group.

In your group, you will first conduct research.
You will use the Exoplanet Archive to query about predictions for the time, and other information, about future transits of a list of strong exoplanet targets. 
There are three central restricting factors we'll have to work around when planning our observations:
1. The Exoplanet Transit
2. The Weather
3. The Telescope Availibility

We will work with you all as much as we can to accomodate or provide alternatives should any of these restricting factors prevent you from being able to obtain your own data, but you would have to be quite unlucky for that to be the case. (Nonetheless, in my grade 10 science class, I built a giant lens and was supposed to demonstrate that it could burn things. From the due date until the end of the semester, it was cloudy every single day, and I was never able to show it in action.) ((That's not particularly relevant, I just wanted to share that story))

There is (will be) a much more detailed and comprehensive description of those factors in the planning instructions section.

## Benediction

Finding a good coincidence where these three factors line up will probably be the most challenging aspect of this project, and, to further complicate things, the most pressured. You will each need to find good times and book observations very early into the semester. You will need to have time to check and make sure you've planned correctly, and then get your data, and leave yourself plenty of time to analyze. You should also be leaving enough time that if something goes wrong (which it often does, especially if it is your first time doing this) you can try again and still have enough time to conduct the analysis and troubleshoot if needed.

You should be putting a large degree of importance and urgency on finding groups and finding a good observing window asap. I cannot stress that enough. It would be impossible to have this done too early, and even a years worth of preparation could still result in a rushed observation, much less a handful of weeks. 

After the rush to get your data has been finished, the project will relax considerably. There will still be a lot to do after this, but we will have the time to take it slow, work on things when it is suitable for us, and wait until we've learned or covered concepts in class to try and implement them in our analysis.

## What Aidan is missing from this (editorial notes)

I don't introduce or describe differential photometry at all, which is a pretty big shortfall I think. I should try and find some place to fit it in maybe?
Or maybe it'd be better to have a more 'technical definitions' and descriptions section, and I can introduce like, differential photometry, and the term "light curve" and other things that people 

Okay so I just got super sidetracked; I started creating a survey (originally I was just going to ask if anyone had other concepts they wanted explained, but then I thought 'oh I should ask more' and then it got out of hand.

As general notes: we could use like, at least one more image, and also tidy it up a bit formatting wise, but that's probably more of an OnQ task. (ie, we'll have to redo it, so we might as well wait.
